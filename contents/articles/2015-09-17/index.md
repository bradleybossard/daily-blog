* Finished a [Dockerfile][1] from yesterday that contains [youtube-dl][2] and [drive][3], a Linux cli client for Google Drive.  Basically, you can download Youtube videos and store them in your Google Drive.  Why?  I'm not sure yet.

* Created my [first automated build in Docker Hub] using my shiny new Dockerfile.
