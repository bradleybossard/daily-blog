* Been doing a lot of app launching via one-click installs from Bitnami
* Launched the Bitnami [ownCloud][1] package on AWS
* Went through process of updating the ownCloud version
* Wondered if there are ownCloud alternatives, tried the 1-click install for [ResourceSpace][2], looks weak
* Read up on Google Container Engine and Kubernetes, got a $300 credit
