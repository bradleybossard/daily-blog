Bradley Bossard is a profesh-ional software developer currently located in Portland, OR with no current intentions of relocating, but you can ask. 

I started this blog b/c I love a wide variety of aspects about programming, everything from graphics to full stack web dev to operating systems to embedded systems (you get the picture) and decided to start creating a log of interesting things I learn everyday to give people a idea of what I might be capable of.  Thanks for reading.
